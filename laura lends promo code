A payday loan can seem like a quick and easy solution for a short-term hiccup in your cash flows. And in the right place at the right time, a short term loan to stretch your cash until the next pay check is just the answer.

But as with any form of borrowing, payday loans have risks and traps, and of course all borrowed money comes at a cost. The cost of a payday loan over the short term, which is what they are designed for, is not very much, and can be compared to the cost of a taking a taxi ride. Like a taxi - payday loans are VERY expensive for a long trip - but justifiable for the short haul on an occasional basis.

So, regardless of what a lender may tell you, if you think you may need to keep a loan for longer than (say) 4 weeks, or two to three paydays, then you should be thinking about other ways to meet your funding needs. If you have a long-term need, or insufficient income to make short-term payments, these are good reasons to avoid getting a payday style of cash advance.

But what are the alternatives? It's easy enough to recommend avoiding payday loans because of the cost, but not so easy in practice. However with a bit thought, and hopefully after reading this, you can explore alternatives before jumping for a payday loan.
